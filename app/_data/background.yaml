    title: Why do we need the Caselaw Access Project?
    text: |
      Our common law - the written decisions issued by our state and federal courts - is not freely accessible online. This lack of access harms justice and equality and stifles innovation in legal services. 

      Every court decision issued in the U.S. should be available for anyone to read online, and those decisions should be available as datasets that researchers can explore and programmers can make more useful.

    title: What is the Caselaw Access Project?
    text: |
      CAP is a mass digitization project in which millions of pages of printed court decisions must be scanned and then converted into machine-readable data.

      CAP also is an open data project in which millions of text files, and lots of data about those text files, must be made accessible online to people who want to read them or interact with them using computer programs.

    title: How are we doing this?
    text: |
      CAP started with the efforts of the Harvard Law School Library over 200 years to build and maintain a nearly comprehensive print collection of all published American caselaw. That collection consists of roughly 40,000 print volumes containing roughly 40 million pages of published court decisions from state and federal courts in the United States.

      In 2013 the Library asked: "What if we digitized this collection and made it available for free online?" That question led us to a collaboration with Ravel Law. From 2013 to 2017 we worked closely with Ravel to build a system for mass, high-speed digitization of print court decisions.

      Today the scanning is complete and we're able to provide the public with free access to every case contained in the Library's collection.
