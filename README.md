Install and Run
---------------
This setup is a clone of [website-static](https://github.com/harvard-lil/website-static).
 
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) or [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) and fire it up.

2. `git clone https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-static.git`

3. `cd cap-static`

4. Fire up the web server and build the site: `make`

5. Check out what you built:
   -  Docker: head to http://localhost:8081/
   -  Docker Machine: run `docker-machine ip` to discover the IP address of your virtualbox. Then, head to http://that-ip-address:8081/

6. To rebuild the website and experience your changes: run `make` again, and refresh your browser window.

7. When you are done playing, to stop the containers: first, run `make down`. Then:
  - Docker: quit the Docker app too, if you like
  - Docker Machine: run `docker-machine stop`, if you like


### More Control

```make up``` (or ```docker-compose up -d```) starts two containers in the background:
1)  a container for building the site
2)  a webserver configured to serve up development and production builds of site.

You have three options for building:
- ```docker-compose exec jekyll grunt``` will build the dev (expanded) version of the site, then will start listening for changes to the app and assets/src directories. It will rebuild on each save/change. The initial build after cloning the repo will be the slowest. Each subsequent rebuild should be shorter. To stop the process, press control + c.
- ```make dev``` or ```docker-compose exec jekyll grunt build:dev``` will build the dev (expanded) version of the site, and then return.
- ```make prod``` or ```docker-compose exec jekyll grunt build:prod``` will build the production (compressed) version of the site, and then return.

To quit and remove your docker images, in addition to the containers, run ```docker-compose down --rmi local```.


### Working on the build environment

If you change any of the contents of the build-environment directory, you need to rebuild the docker image.
- option 1 (best for iterating locally): run ```make rebuild_image``` or ```docker-compose build``` or ```docker-compose up -d --build```
- option 2 (best for when you are finished): increment the tag for cap-website in docker-compose.yml. This ensures that an automatic rebuild is triggered for all users, when they pull in your changes.

If you need to update the Gemfile: update it. Comment out ```RUN bundle config --global frozen 1``` from the Dockerfile. Run ```make rebuild_image``` followed by ```make gemfile_lock_from_container```. Uncomment that line from the Dockerfile, ```make rebuild_image``` again... And you're done.

Periodically, you might want to run ```docker images``` to see if you have accumulated a lot of cruft. Clean up manually, or try running ```docker-compose down --rmi local```.
